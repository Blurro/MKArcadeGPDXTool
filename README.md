# MKArcadeGPDXTool
Tool that extracts/imports Mario Kart Arcade GP DX model files. Well the importing is currently WIP, but exporting .dae files is here!

I'm antsy waiting for the Switch 2 to be hacked so I can dive right into making my first (or possibly THE first) MK World custom character, but since that isn't here yet I figured I'd get some practice in by looking at one of the few remaining unmodded Mario Karts!

## Credits

- **Thanks to [KillzXGaming](https://github.com/killzxgaming)** for their existing work on Switch Toolbox which was a great help for starting this project with, along with identifying and explaining some pieces of data found in the .bin files

- **Thanks to [Wexos](https://github.com/Wexos)** for creating a handy wiki page of this game's BIN/BIKE archive file

## Usage

*Extracting* Just drag and drop any Arcade GP DX .bin file onto the tool (in file explorer, not after opening)

*Importing* Just... wait for it to be done it aint here yet

This is my first time making a tool for an overlooked model format like this and I've definitely learned some things. First custom character on its way!

I've only tested on my own PC/OS and people quite often (rip) have problems with my tools that I don't run into so please contact me on Discord @blurro if you have any issues or suggestions!
